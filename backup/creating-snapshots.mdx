  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Snapshot Storage and Costs

### Storage Optimization

<Info>
**Storage Efficiency:**

- Snapshots use advanced compression algorithms
- Duplicate data blocks are deduplicated
- Only changed data is stored in incremental snapshots
- Storage costs based on actual compressed size
</Info>

### Cost Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Storage Costs">
    **Billing Information**
    - **Rate:** $0.1 per TB per hour (€0.1 per TB per hour | ₹10 per TB per hour)
    - **Billing Method:** Hourly based on actual snapshot size
    - **Compression:** Snapshots are compressed to reduce costs
    - **No Transfer Costs:** No charges for snapshot creation or restoration
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cost Optimization">
    **Reducing Storage Costs**
    - Delete unnecessary snapshots regularly
    - Implement retention policies based on business needs
    - Use incremental backups where possible
    - Monitor snapshot storage usage and trends
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Budget Planning">
    **Cost Estimation**
    - Estimate snapshot size based on VM disk usage
    - Plan for compression ratio (typically 30-70% reduction)
    - Calculate monthly costs based on retention policy
    - Monitor actual costs vs. estimates
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting Snapshot Creation

### Common Creation Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VM State Issues">
    **VM Not Available**
    - **Problem:** No VMs available for snapshotting
    - **Solution:** Ensure at least one VM is in ACTIVE state
    - **Verification:** Check VM status in dashboard
    - **Prevention:** Maintain VMs in operational state
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Account Issues">
    **Account Requirements**
    - **Problem:** Cannot create snapshots due to account status
    - **Solution:** Complete account profile with billing information
    - **Verification:** Check account completion status
    - **Prevention:** Maintain current account information and sufficient credits
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Resource Issues">
    **Resource Limitations**
    - **Problem:** Insufficient storage quota or credits
    - **Solution:** Add credits or clean up existing snapshots
    - **Verification:** Check current credit balance and storage usage
    - **Prevention:** Monitor resource usage and plan capacity
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Technical Issues">
    **Creation Failures**
    - **Problem:** Snapshot creation fails or times out
    - **Solution:** Retry during low VM activity periods
    - **Verification:** Check VM health and performance
    - **Prevention:** Schedule snapshots during maintenance windows
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error Resolution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Issue">
    - Review error messages carefully
    - Check VM status and health
    - Verify account and credit status
    - Assess current system load
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Solution">
    - Address specific error conditions
    - Wait for VM to reach stable state if needed
    - Add credits or complete profile as required
    - Retry during optimal conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Success">
    - Monitor snapshot creation progress
    - Verify snapshot appears in list
    - Check snapshot status reaches "Success"
    - Test snapshot accessibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prevent Recurrence">
    - Document successful procedures
    - Plan optimal timing for future snapshots
    - Monitor account and resource status
    - Establish regular snapshot schedule
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Important Notes:**

- Snapshot creation can take several minutes depending on VM disk size
- The source VM remains operational during snapshot creation
- Snapshot names must be unique across your entire account
- Only VMs in ACTIVE state can be snapshotted
- If no active VMs exist, the Create Snapshot button will be disabled
</Note>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Use descriptive snapshot names that include the date, purpose, and version information. This makes it much easier to identify the right snapshot for restoration later, especially when managing multiple snapshots across different projects.
