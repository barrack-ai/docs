description: "Understanding virtual machine states and billing implications"
---


Virtual machines can exist in various states, each with different billing implications. Understanding these states helps you manage costs effectively.

## Primary VM States

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="ACTIVE" icon="play">
    **The VM is running** with all resources allocated. This is the standard working state.
    
    **Billing:** Full rate (per-minute billing)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="SHUTOFF" icon="stop">
    **The VM is stopped** but resources remain reserved exclusively for your use.
    
    **Billing:** Full rate (per-minute billing)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="HIBERNATED" icon="pause">
    **The VM's state is saved** while hardware resources are released. Only root disk storage remains allocated.
    
    **Billing:** Reduced rate ($0.01/€0.01/₹1.00 per hour)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="DELETED" icon="trash">
    **The VM is permanently removed** with all resources released.
    
    **Billing:** No charge
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Per-Minute Billing

The platform uses precise per-minute billing for optimal cost efficiency:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Billing Precision">
    - **Billing Calculation:** Calculated in one-minute increments for exact usage tracking
    - **No Rounding:** You pay only for the time your resources are actually running
    - **No Minimums:** No minimum usage requirements or rounding to hours
    - **Real-time Tracking:** Costs are tracked and displayed in real-time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="State-Based Billing">
    - **ACTIVE VMs:** Billed at the full GPU rate per minute
    - **SHUTOFF VMs:** Billed at the full GPU rate (resources remain reserved)

## Billing FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How precise is per-minute billing?">
    Billing is calculated to the exact minute. If you use a VM for 37 minutes, you pay for exactly 37 minutes, not a full hour.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens during state transitions?">
    No additional charges apply during transitional states like STARTING, STOPPING, or HIBERNATING. You're only billed when the VM reaches a stable state.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly can I hibernate and restore?">
    Hibernation typically takes 1-2 minutes, and restoration takes 2-3 minutes. The exact time depends on the VM's memory usage and configuration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there any hibernation limitations?">
    Most VMs can be hibernated, but some workloads with specific hardware requirements may have limitations. The system will notify you if hibernation is not available.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I track my usage?">
    Use the [dashboard](https://barrack.ai/dashboard) to monitor real-time usage, costs, and VM states. Historical usage data is also available for analysis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use hibernation strategically to reduce costs by up to 80% for workloads that don't require 24/7 operation. This is especially effective for development and intermittent processing workloads.
