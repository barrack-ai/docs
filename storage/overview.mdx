# Storage Management

The Storage Management system allows you to create and manage persistent storage volumes for your virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Required Before Creating Volumes**

- **Complete Profile:** Your profile must be complete with billing information (address, postal code, country)
- **Minimum Balance:** Account must have sufficient credits:
  - USD: Minimum $1.00
  - EUR: Minimum €1.00
  - INR: Minimum ₹100.00
</Warning>

To check your profile completion status:
1. Navigate to [Account Settings](https://barrack.ai/account)
2. Verify all required fields are completed
3. Ensure billing address is fully filled out

## Volume Types

The platform supports different volume types for various use cases:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Standard Volumes" icon="database">
    **General-purpose storage** for data and applications
    
    **Specifications:**
    - **Minimum size:** 10GB
    - **Maximum size:** 1,048,576GB (1TB)
    - **Performance:** Optimized for GPU workloads
    - **Persistence:** Data persists across VM lifecycles
    - **Attachment:** Can be attached to any VM in the same region
    - **Use cases:** Application data, databases, file storage
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bootable Volumes" icon="hard-drive">
    **Volumes containing an operating system** that can boot a VM
    
    **Specifications:**
    - **Minimum size:** 100GB
    - **Maximum size:** 1,048,576GB (1TB)
    - **Initialization:** Must have a valid OS image
    - **Usage:** Can be used to deploy new VMs
    - **Benefits:** Preserves installed software and configurations
    - **Use cases:** Custom OS setups, pre-configured environments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Volume Storage Pricing

<Info>
**Volume Storage:** $0.1 per TB per hour (€0.1 per TB per hour | ₹10 per TB per hour)

Billing is calculated hourly based on provisioned storage capacity.
</Info>

## Volume Dashboard Statistics

The [Volumes page](https://barrack.ai/volumes) displays key statistics for your storage in the selected region:

- **Total Volumes:** Number of volumes in the selected region
- **Total Storage:** Combined storage allocated across all volumes (in GB)
- **Attached Volumes:** Number of volumes currently attached to VMs
- **Bootable Volumes:** Number of volumes that can be used to boot VMs

## Pagination and Display

Volume management includes efficient pagination:

- 6 volumes displayed per page
- Previous/Next navigation with page numbers
- Pagination controls appear when more than 6 volumes exist
- Grid layout adjusts for desktop (3 columns) and mobile (1 column)

## Volume Operations

    - Standard and bootable volume creation
    - Automatic naming suggestions
    - Real-time validation
    - OS image integration for bootable volumes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Manage Volumes" icon="gear" href="/storage/managing-volumes">

## Volume Status Indicators

Volumes display status indicators to show their current state:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Available
The volume is ready to be attached to a VM
```

```bash Attached/In-use
The volume is currently attached to a VM
```

```bash Creating
The volume is currently being created
```

```bash Error
There was an issue creating or attaching the volume
```
</CodeGroup>

## Storage Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regional Planning">
    **Optimize performance and compliance**
    
    - Create volumes in the same region as your VMs to avoid compatibility issues
    - Consider data residency requirements for compliance
    - Plan for disaster recovery across multiple regions
    - Monitor regional availability and pricing differences
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Capacity Planning">
    **Right-size your storage**
    
    - Size volumes appropriately for your workload to optimize cost
    - Plan for growth but avoid over-provisioning
    - Monitor usage patterns and adjust capacity as needed
    - Use bootable volumes for persistent OS configurations that you want to reuse
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Management">
    **Protect and organize your data**
    
    - Detach volumes before deleting VMs if you want to preserve the data
    - Create regular snapshots before major changes to ensure data recovery options
    - Use descriptive naming conventions for easy identification
    - Implement proper access controls and security measures
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cost Optimization">
    **Manage storage costs effectively**
    
    - Monitor your volume usage to avoid unnecessary storage costs
    - Delete unused volumes to reduce ongoing costs
    - Consider snapshot strategies for long-term data retention
    - Regular cleanup of temporary or test volumes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security & Backup">
    **Ensure data protection**
    
    - Complete your profile and maintain sufficient credits before creating volumes
    - Implement regular backup schedules using snapshots
    - Consider encryption for sensitive data
    - Monitor access logs and unusual activity
  </Accordion>
