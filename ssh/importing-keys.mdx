If you already have SSH keys that you use for other services (GitHub, GitLab, other cloud providers), you can import the public key to use with your virtual machines on our platform.

## SSH Key Import Process

To import an existing SSH public key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to SSH Keys">
    Navigate to the [SSH Keys page](https://barrack.ai/ssh-keys) from the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Import">
    Click "Import Key" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Enter a descriptive name for the key (maximum 50 characters):
    - Names must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods
    - Use descriptive names like "github-key" or "laptop-ssh-key"
    - Choose names that identify the key's source or purpose
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Public Key">
    Paste your public key content in the text area:
    - Key must begin with ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, or similar
    - Include the entire public key on a single line
    - Include optional comment if desired
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Key">
    Click "Import Key" to add it to your account:
    - System validates key format automatically
    - Key is added to your account immediately
    - Available for VM deployment right away
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding Your Public Key

Locate your existing public key on your system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/MacOS">
    **Common Public Key Locations**
    
    Your public key is typically located at:
    ```bash
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub
    ```
    
    **Display and copy your public key:**
    ```bash
    # For RSA keys
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    
    # For Ed25519 keys (recommended)
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    
    # For ECDSA keys
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub
    
    # Copy to clipboard (macOS)
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    
    # Copy to clipboard (Linux with xclip)
    xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">

## Best Practices for Key Import

### Key Selection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose Strong Keys" icon="shield">
    **Security Considerations**
    - Prefer Ed25519 keys for new imports
    - Use RSA keys with 2048+ bits minimum
    - Avoid old or deprecated key formats
    - Verify key source and integrity
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Organize by Purpose" icon="folder">
    **Key Organization**
    - Import separate keys for different purposes
    - Use descriptive names indicating source/purpose
    - Group related keys with consistent naming
    - Document key purposes for team usage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Naming Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Source">
    Include the source service or system in the name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify Purpose">
    Indicate what the key will be used for
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Context">
    Include environment or project information

## Import vs. Creation Comparison

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="When to Import">
    **Import Existing Keys When:**
    - You already have secure, trusted keys
    - You want consistent access across platforms
    - You have established key management procedures
    - You're migrating from another platform
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="When to Create New">
    **Create New Keys When:**
    - You don't have existing SSH keys
    - You want platform-specific keys
    - Your existing keys are old or weak
    - You need fresh keys for security reasons
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
Importing existing SSH keys allows you to use your established keys while keeping your private key secure on your local machine. This is often the preferred method for users who already have a key management system in place.
</Info>

<Tip>
When importing keys from services like GitHub or GitLab, use descriptive names that indicate both the source and purpose. This makes it easier to manage multiple keys and understand their intended use.
