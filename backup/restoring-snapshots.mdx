Restore snapshots to create new virtual machines with the exact configuration and data from when the snapshot was taken.

## Prerequisites for Restoration

- Snapshot must have SUCCESS or available status
- Snapshot must be in a complete, non-corrupted state
- Sufficient credits for new VM deployment
- Valid VM name for the restored instance


## Restoration Process

To restore a snapshot:

1. Navigate to the Snapshots page and locate your snapshot
2. Verify the snapshot status shows SUCCESS or available (green indicator)
3. Click the "Restore" button on the snapshot card
4. Review the snapshot information in the restore modal
5. **Auto-suggestion:** System suggests "{snapshot-name}-restored"
6. Click "Restore Snapshot" to begin the process

## Restore Modal Information

The restore modal displays comprehensive snapshot details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Original snapshot name |
| Size | Storage size in GB |
| VM | Original VM name with server icon |
| Region | Geographic location |
| Created | Full date and time of creation |
| Status | Color-coded status indicator |

## New VM Name Configuration

### Name Requirements

- **Auto-suggestion:** System suggests "{original-snapshot-name}-restored"
- **Length limit:** 1-50 characters with real-time counter
- **Allowed characters:** Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens (-), underscores (_), periods (.)
- **Uniqueness:** Must be unique within your account
- **Validation:** Real-time feedback for invalid names

## What Happens During Restoration

- A completely new virtual machine is created
- All data and configuration from the snapshot is applied
- The new VM gets a new IP address (both private and public if applicable)
- SSH keys need to be reconfigured for access
- The original VM (if it still exists) remains unchanged
- The restored VM will be in the same region as the snapshot

## Restoration States

During the restoration process:

- **Initiating:** Button shows "Restoring..." with spinner animation
- **Processing:** Modal remains open while restoration is in progress
- **Success:** Modal closes and snapshots page refreshes
- **Error:** Error message displayed in red alert box

<Warning>
**Important Restoration Notes**

- Restoration creates a completely new VM - it does not overwrite existing VMs
- The new VM will have a different IP address than the original
- You'll need to update any SSH configurations or firewall rules
- Only snapshots with SUCCESS or available status can be restored
- Restoration process may take several minutes depending on snapshot size
- Ensure you have sufficient credits before starting restoration
</Warning>
