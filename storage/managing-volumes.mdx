  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Volume Details">
    The Volume Attach Modal opens showing:
    - Volume details (name, size, region, type)
    - List of VMs in the same region with ACTIVE status
    - VM information (name, status, region) in a table format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Target VM">
    Select a VM using the radio button selection
  </Step>
