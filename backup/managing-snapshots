Comprehensive tools for viewing, organizing, and managing your snapshot collection throughout their lifecycle.

## Snapshot Details View

Click the info icon (â“˜) on any snapshot to view detailed information:

### Basic Information Section

- **Name:** Full snapshot name
- **VM Name:** Original source VM name
- **Size:** Storage space used in GB
- **Created:** Full timestamp of creation
- **Status:** Color-coded status indicator
- **Image:** Yes/No indicating if snapshot is also an image

### VM Configuration Section

- **Region:** Geographic location of the snapshot

- **RAM:** Memory allocation in GB (if available)
- **GPU:** GPU type and count (if available)
- **Disk:** Storage allocation in GB (if available)

### Description Section

If a description was provided during creation, it appears in a scrollable text area with custom styling. Maximum height of 24px with overflow scrolling for longer descriptions.

## Snapshot Status Indicators

Status badges provide instant visual feedback:

- **SUCCESS / available:** Snapshot is complete and ready for restoration
- **Other states:** Snapshot is processing or encountered an issue

## Deleting Snapshots

Remove snapshots to free up storage space and manage costs:

1. Click the red "Delete" button on any snapshot card
2. A confirmation modal appears with snapshot details
3. Review the warning message about permanent deletion
4. Click "Delete" to confirm, or "Cancel" to abort
5. Deletion process shows spinner and "Deleting..." text
6. Snapshot list automatically refreshes after successful deletion

### Deletion Confirmation Modal

- Shows exact snapshot name being deleted
- Warning triangle icon with danger messaging
- Clear statement that action cannot be undone
- Cancel and Delete buttons with distinct styling
- Delete button becomes disabled during processing
- Loading state with spinner animation

## Refresh and Data Management

Keep your snapshot data current:

- **Automatic Refresh:** List updates automatically after create/delete operations
- **Manual Refresh:** Refresh button with spinning animation during loading
- **Real-time Updates:** Status changes reflect immediately
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for failed operations

## Mobile and Responsive Design

The snapshot interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop:** Full sidebar with 3-column grid layout
- **Mobile/Tablet:** Single column cards with responsive wrapper
- **Touch-Friendly:** Larger buttons and touch targets
- **Optimized Text:** Appropriate font sizes for each screen size

<Warning>
**Deletion Safety**

- Snapshot deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Deleting a snapshot does not affect VMs or images created from it
- Consider creating an image from important snapshots before deletion
- Deletion frees up storage space and reduces ongoing storage costs
- If a snapshot is being used for restoration, wait for completion before deleting
</Warning>

## Storage Best Practices

Recommendations for effective snapshot management:

- Create snapshots regularly for important VMs to enable recovery options
- Use descriptive names that indicate the snapshot's purpose and date
- Monitor your snapshot usage to avoid unnecessary storage costs
- Delete old snapshots that are no longer needed
- Consider creating images from snapshots you want to reuse for deployments
- Create snapshots before major system changes or updates
- Document your snapshots with descriptions for team collaboration

## Snapshot Management Tips

- The page automatically refreshes after snapshot operations to show updated status
- Loading states show progress for create, restore, and delete operations
- Pagination automatically adjusts when snapshots are added or removed
- Region filtering allows you to manage snapshots across different geographic locations
- Snapshot statistics update in real-time as you perform operations
