    - Create new storage volumes as needed
    - Restore data from backups
    - Reconfigure applications and services
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Configurations">
    - Update DNS and networking configurations
    - Test connectivity and performance
    - Update monitoring and logging
    - Validate application functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cleanup Old Resources">
    - Delete old VMs and volumes
    - Clean up networking configurations
    - Update documentation and procedures
