# Attaching Firewalls to VMs

Firewalls must be attached to VMs to take effect. You can manage these attachments through the firewall management interface.

## Attachment Process

To attach a firewall to a virtual machine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Attachment Interface">
    From the firewall card, click the "Attach" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Target VM">
    Select a VM from the list of available machines:
    - Only VMs with ACTIVE status are displayed
    - VMs that have server_uuid are eligible for attachment
    - Single VM selection using radio button interface
    - Already attached VMs are marked with checkmark icon
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Attachment">
    Click "Attach Firewall" to confirm the attachment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Attachment Status">
    Wait for attachment to complete and verify success
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Detachment Security Warning:**

Detaching a firewall immediately removes network protection from the VM. Ensure you have alternative security measures in place or that the VM doesn't require firewall protection before proceeding.
</Warning>

### Detachment Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security Impact">
    **Protection Removal**
    - VM loses firewall protection immediately
    - All blocked connections become allowed

  <Accordion title="Service Continuity">
    **Application Impact**
    - Previously blocked traffic may suddenly be allowed
    - Application behavior may change
    - Monitor for unexpected connections
    - Test application functionality after detachment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alternative Protection">
    **Security Alternatives**
    - Attach different firewall before detaching current one

<Info>
When multiple firewalls are attached to the same VM, all rules apply cumulatively. Plan your firewall architecture carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure optimal security coverage.
</Info>

<Tip>
Always test firewall attachments in a development environment before applying to production VMs. This helps identify potential connectivity issues and rule conflicts before they impact live services.
