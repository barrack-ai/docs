  <Step title="Rule Creation">
    New rules are validated and saved to firewall configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration Propagation">
    Rules are distributed to network infrastructure (up to 10 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Traffic Filtering">
    Rules become active and begin filtering network traffic
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring and Validation">
    Test connectivity and validate rule effectiveness
  </Step>
</Steps>
