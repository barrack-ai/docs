## Credit System FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does per-minute billing work?">
    The platform calculates usage in one-minute increments. You're only charged for the exact time your resources are running, with no minimum usage requirements or rounding to hours.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits?">
    When your credit balance runs low, you'll receive notifications. If you run out completely, your resources will be hibernated to prevent data loss, and you'll need to add credits to resume operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund for unused credits?">
    No, all credit purchases are final and non-refundable. However, credits never expire and remain in your account until used.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer credits between accounts?">
    Credits are tied to individual accounts and cannot be transferred between different accounts or organizations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How are taxes calculated?">
    Taxes are calculated based on your account location. Indian customers pay 18% GST. European customers may pay VAT based on local regulations. US customers typically don't pay additional taxes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I set spending limits?">
    While the platform doesn't enforce hard spending limits, you can set up balance alerts and monitor usage in real-time through the dashboard to manage your spending.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
