## VM Deployment Issues

### Insufficient Credits

If you receive an "Insufficient Credits" error during deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Current Balance">
    Navigate to your [account page](https://barrack.ai/account) to check your current credit balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purchase Additional Credits">
    Add credits to your account through the account page payment section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Minimum Requirements">
    Ensure you meet minimum balance requirements:
    - USD: $1.00
    - EUR: €1.00
    - INR: ₹100.00
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Deployment">
    Return to the [deployment page](https://barrack.ai/deploy) and try again
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Resource Availability

If your selected GPU type or count is unavailable in the region:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Region Alternative">
    **Try Different Regions**
    - Switch to NORWAY-1, CANADA-1, or US-1
    - Check availability in multiple regions
    - Consider latency impact of region choice
    - All regions offer the same GPU types
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="GPU Alternative">
    **Alternative GPU Selection**

    - Reduce the GPU count if multi-GPU setup
    - Consider lower-tier GPUs for development/testing
    - Check GPU comparison in documentation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Timing Strategy">
    **Wait and Retry**
    - GPU availability changes frequently throughout the day
    - Try deploying at different times
    - Set up notifications for availability (if supported)
