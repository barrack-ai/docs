## SSH Connection Guide

### Step 1: SSH Key Creation (On Deploy Page)

SSH keys are created on the deployment page at [barrack.ai/deploy](https://barrack.ai/deploy):

1. Go to **[barrack.ai/deploy](https://barrack.ai/deploy)**
2. **Find the SSH key creation option** on the deploy page
3. **Create a new SSH key** (manual step - not automatic)
4. **Download starts** - key saved to Downloads folder  
5. **File format:** `hh_[keyname].pem`

### Step 2: Get Your Public IP

**If Public IP enabled during deployment:**
- Find your VM in [dashboard](https://barrack.ai/dashboard)
- Copy the Public IP (format: `185.x.x.x`)

**If Public IP not enabled:**
- Go to [dashboard](https://barrack.ai/dashboard) → Click VM **"Details"**
- Enable **"Public IP"** → Wait 1-2 minutes → Copy new IP

### Step 3: Connect via SSH

**Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads
ssh -i "hh_[your-key-name].pem" ubuntu@[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]
```

**Example:**
```cmd
ssh -i "hh_private_key.pem" ubuntu@185.216.21.177
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod 600 hh_[your-key-name].pem
ssh -i hh_[your-key-name].pem ubuntu@[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]
```

<Warning>
Always use **Public IP** (185.x.x.x), NOT Private IP (10.x.x.x). Username is always `ubuntu` for all Barrack images.
</Warning>
