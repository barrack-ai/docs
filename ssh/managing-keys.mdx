### Key Deletion Considerations

<Warning>
**Important Deletion Factors:**

- **Irreversible:** Deleted keys cannot be recovered - this action is permanent
- **VM Access Impact:** You cannot delete keys that are currently in use by active VMs
- **Backup Requirement:** Ensure you have at least one working SSH key before deleting others
- **Global Removal:** Keys are removed from all regions simultaneously
- **Access Loss:** VMs using deleted keys will lose SSH access until a new key is configured
</Warning>

### Pre-Deletion Checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="VM Access Verification">
    **Check VM Dependencies**

## Using SSH Keys with Virtual Machines

SSH keys are automatically integrated into the VM deployment process:

### VM Deployment Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Key Selection">
    In the SSH Key Configuration section of VM deployment, select from your available keys
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Key Selection">
    Multiple keys can be selected for a single VM to allow access by different team members
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Installation">
    Selected keys are automatically installed on the VM during provisioning
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Configuration">
    Keys are configured for the default user account (ubuntu, centos, etc. depending on OS)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connection Examples

**Basic SSH Connection:**
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private_key username@vm_ip_address
```

**Parameter explanations:**
- `/path/to/private_key` - Path to your downloaded private key file
- `username` - Default user for your OS (ubuntu, centos, admin, etc.)
- `vm_ip_address` - Public IP address of your VM

**SSH Config File (Recommended):**

For easier connections, add entries to your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):

```bash
Host my-vm
  HostName 203.0.113.1
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_private_key.pem
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

After adding this configuration, you can connect simply with: `ssh my-vm`

## Regional Key Distribution

SSH keys are automatically distributed across all available regions when created or imported:
