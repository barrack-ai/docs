# SSH Key Configuration

SSH keys provide secure access to your virtual machines. SSH key management requires user authentication.

## SSH Key Requirements

<Warning>
**SSH Key Prerequisites:**

- At least one SSH key is required for VM deployment
- SSH key management requires user authentication
- Keys are automatically distributed to all regions upon creation
- Private keys are only available for download during creation
</Warning>

## Managing SSH Keys

Access your SSH keys through the platform interface:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic Loading" icon="refresh">
    **Seamless Integration**
    - SSH keys are automatically loaded when authenticated
    - Keys are displayed in the deployment interface
    - Multiple keys can be selected for team access
    - Regional distribution is handled automatically
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Key Selection" icon="check-square">
    **Flexible Key Assignment**
    - Keys are automatically selected if you have only one available
    - Multiple keys can be selected for single VM
    - Team members can use different keys
    - Keys remain associated with VMs after deployment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating SSH Keys

Generate new SSH key pairs directly through the platform interface.

### Key Generation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access SSH Keys">
    Navigate to [SSH Keys](https://barrack.ai/ssh-keys) section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Creation">
    Click "Create Key" in the SSH key management interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Enter a unique name for the key (1-50 characters):
    - Use descriptive names like "my-project-key" or "development-server"
    - Names must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods
    - Choose names that help identify the key's purpose
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate and Download">
    Click "Create Key" to generate the keypair:
    - System generates a secure 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair
    - Private key file automatically downloads to your computer

### Finding Your Public Key

Locate your existing public key on your system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/MacOS">
    **Common Public Key Locations**
    
    Your public key is typically located at:
    ```bash
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub
    ```
    
    **Display and copy your public key:**
    ```bash
    # For RSA keys
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    
    # For Ed25519 keys
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    
    # For ECDSA keys
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **Windows Key Locations**
    
    **With Git Bash or WSL:**
    ```bash
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
    
    **Display with Git Bash:**
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
    
    **With PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
    ```
    
    **Common Windows locations:**
    - `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`
    - `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Public Key Format Requirements

Understanding the correct format for import:

<CodeGroup>
```bash RSA Key Example
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC0WGP1EZykEtv5YGC9nMiPFW3U3DmZNzKFO5nEu6uozEHh3JLi9bii user@example.com
```

```bash Ed25519 Key Example
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIE1ZWv7A6ZH9R7O3k6Cq8A5b9J5r8aKz1L2mN3oPq4Rs user@example.com
```

```bash ECDSA Key Example
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBAzq5s... user@example.com
```
</CodeGroup>

**Valid public key requirements:**
- Must begin with key type: `ssh-rsa`, `ssh-ed25519`, or `ssh-dss`
- Contains a long base64-encoded string of characters
- Optionally ends with a comment (usually email address or description)
- Must be on a single line with no line breaks

## Setting Private Key Permissions

After downloading your private key file, you must set the correct permissions for security:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/MacOS">
    **Set Secure Permissions**
    
    ```bash
    chmod 600 /path/to/your_private_key.pem
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/my-barrack-key.pem
    ```
    
    This command ensures only you can read and write the file, which is required for SSH security.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **PowerShell Permission Setting**
    
    ```powershell
    icacls "C:\path\to\your_private_key.pem" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R,W)"
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    ```powershell
    icacls "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\my-barrack-key.pem" /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R,W)"
    ```
    
    This removes inheritance and grants only the current user read/write access.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## SSH Connection Examples

Once your keys are configured, use them to connect to your VMs:

### Basic SSH Connection

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-private-key.pem username@vm-ip-address
```

**Parameter explanations:**
- `/path/to/private_key` - Path to your downloaded private key file
- `username` - Default user for your OS (ubuntu, centos, admin, etc.)
- `vm_ip_address` - Public IP address of your VM

### Username by Operating System

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu Images">
    **Default Username: ubuntu**
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ubuntu@203.0.113.1
    ```
    
    All Ubuntu-based OS images use the `ubuntu` user by default.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Other Linux">
    **Common Default Usernames**
    
    ```bash
    # CentOS/RHEL
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem centos@203.0.113.1
    
    # Amazon Linux
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ec2-user@203.0.113.1
    
    # Debian
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem admin@203.0.113.1
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### SSH Config File (Recommended)

For easier connections, add entries to your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`):

```bash
Host my-vm
  HostName 203.0.113.1
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_private_key.pem
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

After adding this configuration, you can connect simply with:
```bash
ssh my-vm
```

## Key Selection During VM Deployment

During VM deployment, you can configure SSH key access:

  <Step title="Automatic Selection">
    If you have only one SSH key, it's automatically selected
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual Selection">
    If you have multiple keys, choose the appropriate one for the VM
  </Step>
  <Step title="Key Validation">
    System validates key availability and format
  </Step>
  <Step title="VM Integration">
    Selected keys are automatically installed on the VM during provisioning
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multiple Key Selection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Team Access" icon="users">
    **Multiple Key Benefits**
    - Allow access by different team members
    - Each person uses their own SSH key
    - Individual access control and auditing
