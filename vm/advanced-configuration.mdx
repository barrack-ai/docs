# Advanced Configuration

Configure additional options for your virtual machine to enhance security, access, and initial setup capabilities.

## Public IP Configuration

Control whether your VM has internet connectivity and public accessibility.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enable Public IP" icon="globe">
    **Internet Connectivity**
    - VM receives a publicly accessible IP address
    - Full internet access for downloads and updates
    - Accessible from anywhere on the internet
    - Required for remote access and most applications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Disable Public IP" icon="lock">
    **Internal Network Only**
    - VM accessible only within internal network
    - Enhanced security through network isolation
    - No direct internet access
    - Requires VPN or bastion host for access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Public IP Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Security Warning:**

Enabling public IP makes your VM accessible from the internet. Ensure proper security measures:
- Configure firewall rules appropriately
- Use strong SSH keys
- Keep system updated with security patches
- Monitor access logs regularly
</Warning>

### Public IP Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development & Testing">
    **Recommended: Enable Public IP**
    - Easy remote access for development
    - Internet access for package installations
    - Simple collaboration with team members
    - Direct access to web services and APIs
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Production Workloads">
    **Consider Security Requirements**
    - Enable with proper firewall configuration
    - Use load balancers for web applications
    - Implement monitoring and logging
    - Regular security audits
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="High Security Environments">
    **Consider Private Networking**
    - Disable public IP for maximum security
    - Use VPN or bastion hosts for access
    - Implement network segmentation
    - Enhanced compliance for sensitive data
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security Rules Configuration

Configure firewall rules through the integrated interface to protect your virtual machine.

### Firewall Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Security Rules">
    Security rules are configured during VM deployment or through the security management interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Rule Types">
    Add rules for specific protocols:
    - **TCP:** Web services, databases, custom applications
    - **UDP:** DNS, video streaming, custom protocols
    - **ICMP:** Ping, network diagnostics
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Access">
    Define allowed sources and destinations:
    - **IP Ranges:** Specific networks or addresses in CIDR notation
    - **Port Restrictions:** Specific ports or port ranges
    - **Direction:** Ingress (incoming) or Egress (outgoing) traffic
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Rules">
    Rules are applied automatically after VM becomes active:
    - Real-time rule validation
    - Automatic conflict detection
    - Progressive rule application
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Security Rule Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SSH Access">
    **Secure Remote Access**
    - **Protocol:** TCP
    - **Port:** 22
    - **Source:** Your IP address or trusted network
    - **Direction:** Ingress
    
    ```
    Rule: Allow TCP 22 from 203.0.113.0/24
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Web Services">
    **HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**
    - **Protocol:** TCP
    - **Ports:** 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
    - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (public access)
    - **Direction:** Ingress
    
    ```
    Rule: Allow TCP 80,443 from 0.0.0.0/0
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom Applications">
    **Application-Specific Ports**
    - **Protocol:** TCP/UDP (as required)
    - **Port:** Application-specific port
    - **Source:** Trusted networks only
    - **Direction:** Ingress/Egress as needed
    
    ```
    Rule: Allow TCP 8080 from 10.0.0.0/8
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database Access">
    **Database Connectivity**
    - **Protocol:** TCP
    - **Ports:** 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL), etc.
    - **Source:** Application servers only
    - **Direction:** Ingress
    
    ```
    Rule: Allow TCP 5432 from 192.168.1.0/24
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security Rule Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="shield">
    **Minimize Access**
    - Only open ports that are actively needed
    - Restrict source IP ranges to minimum required
    - Regularly audit and remove unnecessary rules
    - Use specific ports instead of ranges when possible
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Defense in Depth" icon="layers">
    **Multiple Security Layers**
    - Combine firewall rules with application security
    - Use both network and host-based firewalls
    - Implement monitoring and intrusion detection
    - Regular security assessments and updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Security rules may take up to 10 minutes to be fully applied after VM deployment. During this time, your VM may appear to have limited connectivity.
</Note>

## Jupyter Notebook Configuration

Optionally enable Jupyter Notebook server for interactive computing and data science workflows.

### Jupyter Setup Process

    - Strong passwords recommended for security
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Jupyter">
    After VM deployment, access via browser:
    ```
    http://<vm-ip>:8888
    ```
  </Step>
